                        Chirpp' is a student 's club started in the year 2016. The club mainly focuses on observing, documenting and creating awareness about various resident and migratory birds and their importance. It also conducts talks on birds by experts, publishes posters
                        and conducts awareness campaigns in the nearby schools. Students from this club are the pioneers in documenting the avifauna specific to Mijar area.

                    <p class="justify ">
                        Since its inception, Chirrp club have been documenting birds regularly in the AIET campus and have accumulated large amount of data on both resident and migratory birds. When checked for previous data on birds in Moodbidre region, we could not find any
                        publications to compare our data. Hence we felt there is a need to publish our accumulated data as this will be an inventory for all those who study the birds in future. A total of 104 bird species belonging to 41 families have
                        been documented. 14 Migratory birds have been noted in the last one year. This will enable to future generations to compare, analyse and make development plans that are environmentally sustainable.

                        We have uploaded the data on the e-bird application which documents birds across the globe. After review, e-bird has declared our campus as one of the hotspots (Public birding location created by e-bird) in the region for birds. Further discussion with
                        our Managing Trustee on publishing the data in the form of a book has enabled this idea turn into a reality.

                        Bird Parks are usually an aviary, where many birds are encouraged to live and breed. An imitation of their natural habitat is created to help birds survive within this enclosed area. This model is seen across the globe and some of these aviaries are world
                        famous. The concept of Bird Park is to allow the people, to observe birds and learn about their lifestyle, habitats and their importance in the natural world. It also acts as an ex-situ conservation measure for those species that
                        may be declining in numbers in the wild.

                    <p class="justify ">
                        On this note, an idea emerged to have a bird park in the Alva's College, which can help students learn about these wonderful creatures and at the same time, can support their conservation in the area. However, keeping the birds captive was something that
                        the team did not want to do. Harish R Bhat, a research scientist at IISc, recommended to have an open bird park where the wild birds visit and nest, and the students can observe these natural behavior. </p>
                    <p class="justify ">
                        A place was identified in the Shobhavana Campus, to start the first ever open bird park. The plan was to have the fruiting and flowering trees that provide food for birds. An open butterfly park also was planned adjacent to the bird park so that the caterpillars
                        of the butterflies and other insects may serve as a food for insectivorous birds. A pond created at the center of the park should be able to host the aquatic birds of the region as well. The team from IISc lead by Dr TV Ramachandra
                        visited the site and gave contours of the region and gave the plan to make the rain water from surrounding areas to be channeled towards the pond.

                        In the month of March, 2017, the pond was excavated at the bird park and the soil necessary for planting the saplings were brought in. Muthappanna, who was taking care of the nursery had started procuring the saplings from the list of plants given by
                        Harish R Bhat. By May, 2017, the soil brought in was laid out and ready for planting. As soon as the rain started by mid-May, buffalo grass were planted across to stabilize the soil. </p>

                    <p class="justify ">
                        Considering the rainfall in this region, we did not have to worry about the water and the saplings started growing very well. As they grew, a large variety of insects started to appear in the bird park. This already had started drawing the attention of
                        some of the common insectivorous birds in the campus like Mynas. Tailorbirds, Prinias etc.

                        In August, we were able to notice many insects, some small reptiles and amphibians appearing. Following them was more number of birds. Indian Peafowl was a common sighting. The water in the pond had completely seeped in, as it was a new pond and the ground
                        water has to be recharged, before it can sustain water on the surface.

                        Since then, every month students along with researchers have monitored the bird diversity and the interesting interactions between various organisms. The plants in the park have been growing well and many can be observed flowering or fruiting and some
                        plants today can be seen grown over 12 Ft in height. This has resulted in addition of several species of birds in the campus and seasonally, some of the aquatic birds also visit the park while the pond retains water.

                    <h2>Background</h2>

                    <p>Birds are an integral part of an eco-system. They are important because they keep systems in balance, pollinate plants, disperse seeds, scavenge carcasses and recycle nutrients back into the earth. They are one of the diverse group
                        of organisms with around 10,000 species globally. They have inhabited all the habitats on the planet right from the rich wetlands to cold and hot desserts. However, their numbers across the globe are reducing due to rapid urbanization,
                        loss of forest lands for agriculture, monoculture and various types of pollution.

                    </p>

                        Understanding the importance and the need for conservation of birds, Alva's Institute of Engineering and Technology provided us an opportunity to study the bird diversity at the Shobhavana Campus under the guidance of researchers from Indian Institute
                        of Science, Bengaluru, through the Chirpp club, which is a bird watching club at the campus. Hence a study was performed for the duration of one year, in documenting the diversity of birds, identifying the resident and migratory
                        species and the areas within the campus that they inhabit.

                            We find birds all around us no matter where we are. In general terms, they can be easily defined as they are the only creature with feathers. All birds might seem quite similar except for their size and colourful feathers. However, with keen observation
                            it becomes evident that each species is extremely different from one another right from the way they fly to complex behaviours and way of life. It is astonishing that some birds travel across the globe while others are restricted
                            to very small areas. Like any living organism, birds are well adapted to their environment; to reach or catch the food they eat, or to escape from the predators they share the habitats with. There are certain habitats on the
                            planet that take the conditions to the extreme, where only few organisms have managed to adapt and survive and birds have adapted themselves to thrive in these harsh conditions.

                        <p class="justify ">Birds are an integral part of any ecosystem around the world. It is estimated that there are about 10000 species of birds in the world of which about 1301 are in India. These numbers show how diverse the birds are around us. The
                            diverse geographical conditions in our country are the prime reason for hosting such diversity of avifauna. In Karnataka, about 531 species have been documented. Western Ghats has about 508 species of birds of which 19 are
                            known to be endemic. Moodbidre - a small town in Dakshina Kannada district of Karnataka lies amidst the Western Ghats and hosts a variety of birds. It was observed that no study was taken up in this area to document the avifauna
                            specific to Moodbidre. Considering birds are bio-indicators of a healthy environment, an attempt to document the bird diversity has been made at a small portion of Moodbidre town-Alva's Shobhavana Campus situated at Mijar.
