                            survival of various ecosystems and the creatures that live in them.</p>
                        <p>He is an individual who understands the value of using artistic expression to spread awareness of the fragility and beauty of nature. He has used numerous artistic forms, to spread awareness of environmental concerns. He has effectively
                            conveyed the need for conservation and inspired others to take action through these artistic endeavours.</p>
